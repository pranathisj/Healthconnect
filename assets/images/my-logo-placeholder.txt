Place your logo image here as `my-logo.png` (or `my-logo.jpg`).

You provided an image attachment; please save that file as:

  assets/images/my-logo.png

or

  assets/images/my-logo.jpg

This will be displayed in the site header. If you want me to write the actual image file into the workspace, paste the base64 representation of the image here and I will create the binary file for you.
